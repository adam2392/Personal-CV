My thesis work focuses on developing algorithms in the context of seizure localization in drug-resistant epilepsy patients. Specifically, I analyze multivariate time-series intracranial EEG data using dynamical systems, control theory, machine learning and statistics. I combine biological understanding of the brain with mathematical models of dynamical systems. I also utilize machine learning and statistical models to answer relevant hypothesis-driven questions. I combine these approaches with neuroimaging data analyses of T1 MRI and CT data to analyze the anatomical spatiotemporal dynamics present in epileptic neuronal networks. My research interests are broadly in the intersection areas of neuroscience, machine learning and statistics, control theory and dynamical systems. I am also extremely passionate about open-source everything.
